# Basic Recipe Website

## Project Description

This project is a practice exercise to solidify your understanding of HTML. The goal is to build a simple recipe website focusing entirely on HTML. Design and styling are not part of this phase.

## Website Content

* **index.html** – The homepage of the website containing links to several recipe pages.
* **Individual recipe pages** – Each recipe page includes a list of ingredients and preparation steps for a specific dish.

## Objective

The website must be **functional**:

* All pages must be correctly linked.
* Use proper semantic HTML structure.
* No CSS, no JavaScript – strictly plain HTML.

## Note

This is an HTML-only project for practice purposes. It will be revisited later to add styling with CSS.
